# golang-datastructures

## **Disclaimer: This isa work in progress.**

A full set of packages, each for every major data structure (linked lists, binary trees, etc) made from scratch in Go.

This is a personal project to help me move forward in my understanding of both Golang as a language and Data Structures as a field.

**Package linkdlist covers both single and doubly linked lists with implementations for:**
- Creating an empty list which nodes can nold any sort of data types.
- Adding new nodes (as head).
- Inserting new nodes after a specified node.
- Find a node based on its value.
- Delete a node based on its value.

**Note:** Finding nodes functionality crashes when trying to look for an slice or arrays. I'm trying to solve this issue by implementing the reflect library, yet I have not succeeded at that. Any help in that regard would be greatly appreciated.

The main.go file is just a placeholder to showcase the funcionality of the rest of the packages.

Enjoy!
